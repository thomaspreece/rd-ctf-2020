        The CTF competition is now finished. The scoreboard and scores are now frozen and no longer visible. If you competed then feel free to continue completing challenges. If you are new then feel free to register and complete challenges at your leisure. You may no longer be able to win the competition but you can still get the satisfaction of solving challenge :)

      <p>
        Weclome to the 2020 edition of the BBC R&ampD CTF. I've setup a selection of challenges for you to play with. Hopefully you have fun and enjoy the experience. The top 10 participants/groups at the end of the CTF will win an R&amp;D CTF Sticker to proudly display on your laptop (or zoom background).
      </p>
      <p>
        The competition starts at 11.10 on Monday November 2nd 2020 and will finish on Friday November 13th 2020 at midnight.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system is setup to allow you to work in teams. Feel free to pair up or form a group to solve challenges together, I'd even actively encourage it as you'll likely learn more :)

      <p>
        Good Luck and Happy Hacking
      <p>
      <h2>Rules of Engagement</h2>
      <p>
        Please hack responsibly and adhere to the rules. You are welcome to use any tools you have at your disposal but please avoid automatic scanning tools such as dirb or sqlmap as they may DDOS the server and ruin the game for others. None of the challenges have been designd to require automated scanning tools so you won't be at a disadvantage by not using them (and some challenges actively prevent them). <br/>
        Only the following domains are <b>VALID for hacking against</b>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anything under *.ctf.rd-security-training.bbctest01.uk</li>
        <li>juiceshop.training.bbc-security-champions.com</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The following domains are <b>NOT VALID for hacking against</b>:
      <ul>
        <li>ctfd.rd-security-training.bbctest01.uk</li>
		<li>Anything else under rd-security-training.bbctest01.uk or bbctest01.uk</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Getting Help</h2>
      <p>
      	If you are in R&amp;D you can get help from the rd-ctf slack channel. Alternatively you can message tomp on slack directly. Also pay close attension to the challenge title and text within. The challenges are written in a way that key words are included to hint towards the solution. <br/>
        These challenges are designed to stretch you so don't be put off if you don't get them immediately, I'll be on hand to offer out hints (and the challenges also have hints too!). Solutions to the challenges will be available after the competition.
      </p>
      <h2>New Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Generally the point value of a challenge will show how difficult it is. A chunk of challenges are labelled "JuiceShop", these are using the same tool that has been used in previous hacking workshops so most of you should be familiar with it already. Because of this, these JuiceShop challenges are lower point values then the other unseen challenges. So you may actually find some higher point challenges easier to do then the JuiceShop ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of the competition new challenges will become available so if you are struggling with existing challenges check back later for some new ones that you may have more luck with.
